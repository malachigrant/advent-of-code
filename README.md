# Advent of Code
 
This is my first year doing Advent of Code, so I am using Javascript, since it is the language I am most familiar with. I'm still tweaking the repository to find ways to make my workflow more efficient. So far, I have code snippets for quickly creating days and tests, and I have a script that creates the files for me so I don't have to fiddle around making a bunch of different files in different folders.

## Scripts

`yarn day <num> [time]` - Runs part 1 and 2 for a day against actual input files (not in Git). Optionally, add `time` to time each part.

`yarn addDay <num>` - Creates starter files for a day. Includes test input, real input, day code, and day test.

`yarn test` - Runs tests.
